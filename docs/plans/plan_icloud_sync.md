# Apple iCloud sync adapter (CloudKit)

**Status**: Open

**PR link**: {A link to the PR submitted for this plan}

**Implementation model:** Sonnet, **after the Phase 4a empirical probe**; the probe
is human-run on a real iOS/macOS device with an iCloud-enabled Apple developer
account.

**Roadmap**: docs/roadmap/0_03.md

**Prerequisites**:

- ✅ `plan_sync_cas_atomicity.md` (H5) — **COMPLETE** (now in
  `docs/plans/completed/`). Landed: the `providesAtomicCas` getter on
  `SyncStorageAdapter`, `ConsolidationCoordinator` gating on it, and the
  reusable `runSyncAdapterConformance({required factory, required
  expectAtomicCas})` suite at
  `packages/kmdb/test/support/sync_adapter_conformance.dart`.
- ✅ **`plan_harness_mixed_storage.md` — COMPLETE (PR #34, branch
  `20260601_plan_harness_mixed_storage`).** Landed: `CloudProfile`
  (`atomicConditionalCreate`, `allowsDuplicateNames`, `consistency`,
  `quota`) at
  `packages/kmdb/lib/src/test_cloud/cloud_profile.dart`; the per-device
  adapter factory (`HarnessConfig.syncAdapterFactory`) and
  `SharedCloudBackend` / `SharedBackendAdapter` / `CloudSemanticsAdapter`
  exported via `package:kmdb/kmdb_test_cloud_support.dart`. The Phase 4
  simulation framework is ready.
- 🔄 **`plan_google_drive_sync.md` — In progress** (worktree
  `20260602_plan_google_drive_sync`). That plan's Phase 4 prerequisite step
  establishes the conformance suite's public export path
  (`package:kmdb/test_support.dart`, moving `sync_adapter_conformance.dart`
  from `test/` into `lib/`). This plan's Phase 4 consumes that export — it
  does **not** repeat the move. This plan's Phase 4 is gated until the Drive
  plan's Phase 4 prerequisite step lands.

## Problem statement

KMDB's sync protocol uses `SyncStorageAdapter` as its cloud backend abstraction.
This plan implements an `ICloudAdapter` backed by Apple's CloudKit, giving iOS
and macOS users a zero-infrastructure sync location tied to their Apple ID —
no account setup beyond the iCloud account already on their device.

The `docs/spec/01_overview.md` specifically calls out the CloudKit value
proposition: "CloudKit offers atomic batch operations and push notifications.
Worth a dedicated adapter? Yes, as a v2 cloud adapter alongside Google Drive.
Different API but same sync protocol." This plan implements exactly that
recommendation. The roadmap entry "Cloud adapter: Apple iCloud" (in
`docs/roadmap/0_03.md`) is the target.

The plan covers **CloudKit only**. iCloud Drive (Apple's consumer file sync
service, accessible via Flutter plugins such as `icloud_storage_plus`) is
evaluated and excluded — see the API decision in the Investigation.

## Open questions

- [x] **Q-A1 — API choice (CloudKit vs iCloud Drive).** RESOLVED: CloudKit
      custom zones. The platform channel architecture (Phases 2–3) follows from
      this decision.
- [x] **Q-A2 — CLI support.** RESOLVED: out of scope for this plan. `kmdb_cli`
      is a Dart binary (no Flutter runtime, no method channels); `kmdb_ui`
      integration is also deferred. This plan delivers the `kmdb_icloud` package
      (adapter + platform channel plugin + tests) only.
- [ ] **Q-A3 — `ICloudSyncChannel` as the test seam.** The plan proposes an
      `abstract interface class ICloudSyncChannel` in Dart, with a production
      implementation using `MethodChannel` and a test-only in-memory
      implementation over `SharedCloudBackend`. Confirm this is the right
      abstraction boundary (vs mocking directly at the `MethodChannel`
      dispatcher level).
- [ ] **Q-A4 — CloudKit container identifier.** CloudKit containers are
      identified by a bundle-prefix string (e.g.
      `iCloud.au.com.bettongia.kmdb`). This value must be provisioned in the
      Apple Developer account and embedded in the app. Confirm whether the
      container ID is hardcoded in the package or supplied at construction
      time (latter is more testable).
- [ ] **Q-A5 — Phase 4a probe operationally.** Phase 4a requires an iOS/macOS
      app target with a configured CloudKit container and iCloud-enabled
      device. Confirm that the project has or can obtain an Apple developer
      account with a test CloudKit container for this probe, and that a
      dedicated probe target (separate from the main app) is acceptable.

## Investigation

### Existing adapter interface

`SyncStorageAdapter` (in `packages/kmdb/lib/src/sync/sync_storage_adapter.dart`)
defines six methods:

| Method                                       | Notes                          |
| -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| `list(dir, {extension})`                     | Returns bare filenames only    |
| `download(path)`                             | Returns `null` if file absent  |
| `upload(path, bytes)`                        | Overwrites if exists           |
| `delete(path)`                               | No-op if absent                |
| `compareAndSwap(path, bytes, {ifMatchEtag})` | `null` etag = if-none-match:\* |
| `getEtag(path)`                              | Returns `null` if absent       |

All ETags are implementation-specific opaque strings. The lease protocol in
`ConsolidationCoordinator` depends entirely on `compareAndSwap` behaving
atomically from the server's perspective.

### API choice: CloudKit vs iCloud Drive

#### iCloud Drive (via Flutter plugin)

iCloud Drive exposes the user's iCloud-synced file container as a familiar
file-system-like API. The most capable Flutter plugin is `icloud_storage_plus`
(MIT, full pub points, coordinated iOS/macOS access).

**Advantages:**
- Natural 1:1 file mapping — SSTables, `.hwm` files, and the lease file all
  map directly to iCloud Drive files.
- Simple to implement; no custom native code needed.

**Disadvantages:**
- **No ETags.** The plugin does not expose file revision tokens or content
  hashes. Implementing ETags would require custom Objective-C/Swift code
  using `NSFileVersion` or `NSFileCoordinator` — which still only provides
  local coordination, not server-side atomicity.
- **Eventually consistent across devices.** iCloud Drive syncs files in the
  background; iOS controls when syncs occur and files become visible to a
  second device. There is no way to programmatically trigger iCloud sync
  from Dart.
- **`providesAtomicCas = false` is mandatory.** Two devices can both write
  local copies of the lease file; iOS reconciles them later (last-write-wins
  at the filesystem level). The lease cannot protect against concurrent
  consolidation.
- ConsolidationCoordinator will skip consolidation (loss-free per H5), but
  SSTables accumulate without being consolidated.

#### CloudKit custom zones

CloudKit is Apple's structured cloud database. Each record has a `recordType`,
typed fields, and an optional `CKAsset` for binary blobs. Records in a **custom
private zone** have server-enforced sequencing and atomic batch semantics. The
platform-native `CloudKit` framework (Swift/Objective-C) is available on iOS
and macOS; the Dart side drives it via a Flutter `MethodChannel`.

**Advantages:**
- **True atomic CAS.** Two devices simultaneously creating a record with the
  same deterministic `CKRecord.ID` in the same custom zone will result in
  exactly one success — the zone's update counter serialises writes. A
  create-if-absent produces a single winner. Update-with-`If-Match` is
  similarly atomic via `savePolicy: .ifServerRecordUnchanged`.
- **ETags via `recordChangeTag`.** CloudKit assigns an opaque, stable
  `recordChangeTag` on each record save, directly usable as the adapter's
  ETag.
- **`providesAtomicCas = true` (pending Phase 4a verification).** Full
  consolidation support.
- **Implicit auth.** No OAuth; the user's iCloud sign-in on the device is the
  credential. No token storage, no browser redirect.
- **Push notifications.** Out of scope for this plan, but CloudKit's
  subscription model can notify devices of new SSTables without polling — a
  future enhancement.

**Disadvantages:**
- **No mature Dart/Flutter CloudKit package.** `cloudkit_flutter` (v0.1.4,
  37 pub downloads) and `flutter_cloud_kit` (v0.0.3, 164 downloads) do not
  expose custom zones, conditional saves, or asset download — the operations
  KMDB needs. A purpose-built `ICloudSyncChannel` plugin must be written.
- **iOS/macOS only.** CloudKit requires Apple platforms. No Android, no web,
  no Windows/Linux.
- **Records, not files.** Binary SSTables are stored as `CKAsset` blobs
  attached to `CKRecord` metadata records. This indirection is manageable but
  means every operation involves both a metadata fetch and an asset
  download/upload.
- **CLI not supported.** See Q-A2.

#### Decision: CloudKit

CloudKit is the recommended implementation target. The spec's explicit
endorsement of CloudKit's atomic operations, and the architecture's reliance on
a working lease protocol (`providesAtomicCas = true` → consolidation enabled),
make the extra implementation complexity worthwhile. iCloud Drive's inability
to provide atomic CAS makes it a weaker fit, even though its file model is more
natural for KMDB's SSTable layout.

### CloudKit storage model

Each KMDB sync file is a `CKRecord` of type `"KMDBSyncFile"` in a custom
private zone:

```
CKContainer: <containerIdentifier>          (e.g. iCloud.au.com.bettongia.kmdb)
└── Private Database
    └── Custom Zone: "kmdb-<syncRoot>"      (one zone per syncRoot name)
        ├── KMDBSyncFile:<path>             (record type + deterministic record name)
        │   ├── path: String               (the full relative path, e.g. "sstables/abc.sst")
        │   └── content: CKAsset           (the file bytes, stored on Apple's servers)
        │   recordChangeTag → ETag
        ├── KMDBSyncFile:sstables/...
        ├── KMDBSyncFile:highwater/...
        └── KMDBSyncFile:.consolidation-lease
```

**Record ID strategy:** `CKRecord.ID(recordName: <path>, zoneID: zone.zoneID)`.
This gives each "file" a globally unique, deterministic key within the zone.
CloudKit guarantees exactly one record per `recordID` per zone.

**Sync folder layout** is unchanged from the rest of the engine:

```
{syncRoot}/               ← encoded as the CloudKit zone name
  highwater/
    {deviceId}.hwm        ← path = "highwater/{deviceId}.hwm"
  sstables/
    *.sst                 ← path = "sstables/{filename}"
  .consolidation-lease    ← path = ".consolidation-lease"
```

### SyncStorageAdapter → CloudKit mapping

| Adapter method                          | CloudKit operation |
| --------------------------------------- | -------------------|
| `list(dir, {extension})`                | `CKQuery` on zone with `NSPredicate("path BEGINSWITH %@", dir + "/")`, filtered by extension suffix. Returns bare filenames (strip the `dir + "/"` prefix). |
| `download(path)`                        | `CKFetchRecordsOperation` for deterministic record ID; download `CKAsset` file to temp path; read bytes; return `null` on not-found error. |
| `upload(path, bytes)`                   | Write bytes to a temp file; create `CKAsset`; save `CKRecord` with `savePolicy: .changedKeys` (update) or `.allKeys` (create). Caller does not distinguish — the adapter checks existence first (or tries create then falls back to update on conflict). |
| `delete(path)`                          | `CKModifyRecordsOperation` delete by deterministic record ID; swallow `CKError.unknownItem`. |
| `compareAndSwap(path, bytes, {etag})`   | See below. |
| `getEtag(path)`                         | `CKFetchRecordsOperation` with `desiredKeys: []` (metadata only, no asset download); return `record.recordChangeTag`; `null` on not-found. |

### compareAndSwap on CloudKit

**Update path (`ifMatchEtag != null`):** Create a local `CKRecord` with the
deterministic record ID and the known server `recordChangeTag` set on it. Save
with `savePolicy: .ifServerRecordUnchanged`. If the server's tag no longer
matches, CloudKit returns `CKError.serverRecordChanged` → return `false`. If it
matches, the write succeeds → return `true`. This is the standard conditional-
update atomic operation, well-documented in CloudKit.

**Create-if-absent path (`ifMatchEtag == null`):** Create a fresh local
`CKRecord` (no server record, nil `recordChangeTag`) with the deterministic
record ID. Save with `savePolicy: .allKeys`. If the server already has a record
with that ID, CloudKit returns `CKError.serverRecordChanged` (the local record
with no change tag conflicts with the existing server record that has one) →
return `false`. If no record exists, it is created → return `true`.

**Atomicity caveat — must be verified empirically.** The create-if-absent
path relies on CloudKit's zone-level sequencing ensuring exactly one winner
among concurrent creates for the same record ID. This is the expected behaviour
for custom zones, but it **must be verified** in Phase 4a against the real
CloudKit service before the adapter declares `providesAtomicCas = true`. Until
Phase 4a confirms it, the adapter defaults to `providesAtomicCas = false`
(loss-free posture: consolidation coordinator skips consolidation).

> **Scope constraint (Q-A1).** The lease design uses the deterministic record
> ID within the `"kmdb-<syncRoot>"` custom private zone. This keeps all KMDB
> sync data in one zone and avoids requesting additional CloudKit permissions.
> If Phase 4a shows that zone-level serialisation does not guarantee a single
> winner on simultaneous creates with the same record ID, the adapter declares
> `providesAtomicCas = false` (loss-free) — it does **not** attempt a
> workaround via a different CloudKit API surface.

### ETag strategy

CloudKit's `recordChangeTag` is an opaque, server-assigned string that changes
on every successful record save. It is available as a metadata field on
`CKRecord` without downloading the `CKAsset`. This is a clean ETag: it changes
on every write, it is stable for a given revision, and it matches what the
`compareAndSwap` conditional-save machinery expects.

### Dart/Flutter package landscape

No existing Dart/Flutter package provides the CloudKit operations this adapter
needs (custom zones, conditional saves, `CKAsset` upload/download,
`CKQuery` with predicate). The two available packages:

| Package | Version | Downloads | Gap |
| ------- | ------- | --------- | --- |
| `cloudkit_flutter` | 0.1.4 | 37 | No custom zones; no conditional save |
| `flutter_cloud_kit` | 0.0.3 | 164 | No zones; no asset support |

**Conclusion:** The `kmdb_icloud` package must include a purpose-built
`ICloudSyncPlugin` in Swift and an `ICloudSyncChannel` Dart abstraction. This
is standard Flutter federated-plugin practice. The Swift layer wraps the native
`CloudKit` framework; the Dart layer calls it via `MethodChannel`.

### Platform scope

**iOS and macOS are both first-class targets.** CloudKit and the platform
channel plugin are supported on both platforms; macOS desktop Flutter
applications (the primary target for `kmdb_ui`) are an explicit use case. The
Swift plugin is shared across both platform targets. Android, web, Windows, and
Linux are excluded — they do not have iCloud access. Users who want
cross-platform sync should use the Google Drive adapter.

CLI (`kmdb_cli`) support is out of scope (Q-A2 resolved). A macOS Dart CLI
binary cannot use Flutter method channels. CLI access to CloudKit would require
FFI to a native Swift library or helper binary; that complexity is not part of
this plan.

### Simulator approach (test seam)

The Google Drive plan's behavioural simulator sits below the `googleapis`
`DriveApi` as a fake `http.Client`. For CloudKit, the analogous seam is the
`ICloudSyncChannel` abstraction (not an HTTP client):

- **Production:** `PlatformICloudSyncChannel` calls the native Swift plugin via
  `MethodChannel`. The Swift plugin uses the real `CloudKit` framework.
- **Tests:** `FakeICloudSyncChannel` implements the same interface in Dart,
  over `SharedCloudBackend` from the harness plan. It models the CloudKit
  semantics verified in Phase 4a (atomicity, consistency delay, quota errors).

Because `ICloudAdapter` takes an `ICloudSyncChannel` at construction, the real
adapter code is exercised in tests — the abstraction boundary is between Dart
and Swift, not between the adapter and the adapter's caller.

### CloudProfile (preliminary)

The Drive `CloudProfile` shape is already in code at
`packages/kmdb/lib/src/test_cloud/cloud_profile.dart`. The iCloud `CloudProfile`
instance ships with the simulator (Phase 4):

```dart
// CloudKit CloudProfile — preliminary; atomicConditionalCreate and
// consistency values are finalised by the Phase 4a empirical probe.
CloudProfile(
  consistency: EventualConsistency(
    maxPropagationDelayMs: /* Phase 4a result */,
    jitterMs: /* Phase 4a result */,
  ),
  atomicConditionalCreate: false, // safe default; set to true only if
                                  // Phase 4a confirms zone serialisation
                                  // guarantees single-winner creates
  allowsDuplicateNames: false,    // CloudKit zones: one record per ID, no
                                  // duplicate record names possible
  quota: QuotaProfile(
    maxOpsPerMinute: /* from CKError.requestRateLimited / Apple docs */,
    maxUploadBytesPerDay: null,   // or derive from 2 GB daily transfer quota
  ),
)
```

## Implementation plan

### Phase 1 — Package scaffold

- [ ] Create `packages/kmdb_icloud/` with standard layout: `lib/`, `test/`,
      `ios/`, `macos/`, `pubspec.yaml`, `README.md`
- [ ] `pubspec.yaml`: Flutter plugin; dependencies: `flutter`, `kmdb`. Platform
      declarations for `ios` and `macos` plugin classes (Swift).
- [ ] Add `kmdb_icloud` to root workspace `pubspec.yaml`
- [ ] Add `kmdb_icloud` entry to `melos.yaml` if one exists
- [ ] Add license header to all new Dart and Swift source files (use
      `@header_template.txt` for Dart; Apache 2.0 comment block for Swift)
- [ ] Add `kmdb_icloud` to `CLAUDE.md` package table

### Phase 2 — Platform channel plugin (`ICloudSyncChannel`)

- [ ] Define `abstract interface class ICloudSyncChannel` in
      `lib/src/icloud_sync_channel.dart` with methods mirroring the six
      `SyncStorageAdapter` operations (typed for the channel boundary — path
      strings, byte lists, nullable etag strings). This is the Dart-side
      contract the adapter calls and tests mock.
- [ ] Implement `PlatformICloudSyncChannel` using `MethodChannel
      'kmdb_icloud/sync'`. Serialises call arguments to/from the channel
      (paths as `String`, bytes as `Uint8List`, etags as `String?`).
- [ ] Implement `ICloudSyncPlugin.swift` in `ios/Classes/` and
      `macos/Classes/` (shared Swift source via symlink or conditional):
  - CloudKit initialisation: `CKContainer(identifier:)` → private database →
    custom zone `CKRecordZone(zoneName: "kmdb-\(syncRoot)")`, created lazily
    on first use.
  - Zone ID cache: once the zone is confirmed to exist, cache its
    `CKRecordZone.ID` in memory.
  - Method handler: dispatch channel calls to `list`, `download`, `upload`,
    `delete`, `compareAndSwap`, `getEtag` implementations.
  - Error mapping: `CKError.unknownItem` → file-not-found sentinel;
    `CKError.serverRecordChanged` → CAS failure sentinel;
    `CKError.requestRateLimited` → retriable error with backoff hint.

### Phase 3 — Core adapter implementation

- [ ] Implement `ICloudAdapter` in `lib/src/icloud_adapter.dart`
      implementing `SyncStorageAdapter`
- [ ] Constructor accepts `ICloudSyncChannel channel` and `String syncRoot`
      (zone name suffix). Production callers pass `PlatformICloudSyncChannel`;
      tests pass `FakeICloudSyncChannel`.
- [ ] `list(dir, {extension})` — delegate to channel; strip `dir + "/"` prefix
      from returned paths; filter by extension.
- [ ] `download(path)` — delegate to channel; return `null` on file-not-found.
- [ ] `upload(path, bytes)` — delegate to channel; channel's Swift layer writes
      bytes to a temp file, wraps in `CKAsset`, saves record with
      `savePolicy: .changedKeys` (creates if record is new, updates if
      existing).
- [ ] `delete(path)` — delegate to channel; channel swallows not-found.
- [ ] `compareAndSwap(path, bytes, {ifMatchEtag})` — delegate to channel;
      return `true`/`false` per the CAS semantics above.
- [ ] `getEtag(path)` — delegate to channel; return `null` if absent.
- [ ] `bool get providesAtomicCas` — defaults to `false` until Phase 4a
      empirically confirms atomic create. Updated to `true` if Phase 4a
      confirms it.
- [ ] Expose `ICloudAdapter` as the package's public API via
      `lib/kmdb_icloud.dart`

### Phase 4 — Behavioural CloudKit simulator + tests

**Phase 4 prerequisite:** the conformance suite export path
(`package:kmdb/test_support.dart`) must be established by the Google Drive
plan's Phase 4 step before this phase begins.

#### Phase 4a — Empirical CloudKit behaviour probe (must run first)

Build a small, credential-gated probe app (an iOS/macOS test target with a
configured CloudKit container) that records what real CloudKit actually does:

- [ ] Probe **zone-level create atomicity**: two clients simultaneously create
      a `CKRecord` with the **same deterministic record ID** in the same custom
      zone (using fresh local records with no `recordChangeTag`). Does exactly
      one succeed and the other receive `CKError.serverRecordChanged`? What are
      the observed status codes under both `CKModifyRecordsOperation` and the
      convenience `CKDatabase.save()` path?
- [ ] Probe **conditional update atomicity** (`savePolicy:
      .ifServerRecordUnchanged`): concurrent updates to the same record ID with
      the same `recordChangeTag`. Confirm exactly one wins, others receive
      `CKError.serverRecordChanged`.
- [ ] Probe **`CKQuery` consistency**: time-to-visibility of a newly created
      record to a second client via `CKQueryOperation`; whether queries are
      read-your-writes consistent immediately after a save on the same device.
- [ ] Probe **CKAsset upload/download**: maximum observed SSTable size (probe
      at 1MB, 10MB, 50MB); upload latency; whether partial/failed uploads
      leave orphaned assets; whether `savePolicy: .changedKeys` on a record
      with a changed `CKAsset` re-uploads the full asset or diffs.
- [ ] Probe **rate-limit and quota error shapes**: `CKError.requestRateLimited`
      and `CKError.quotaExceeded` — structure, `retryAfterSeconds` field
      availability.
- [ ] **Record all findings in this plan** (a results table) and derive the
      CloudKit `CloudProfile` values and the final `providesAtomicCas` setting
      from them.

#### Phase 4 — Simulator and test suite

- [ ] Implement `FakeICloudSyncChannel` in `test/` over `SharedCloudBackend`
      (from `package:kmdb/kmdb_test_cloud_support.dart`):
  - Implements `ICloudSyncChannel`; models the CloudKit semantics verified in
    Phase 4a (zone-level sequencing for CAS, eventual consistency delay,
    `CKError.serverRecordChanged` on CAS failure, no duplicate record IDs).
  - Implements `kmdb_harness`'s `QuotaAwareAdapter` (single member
    `safeOperationThreshold`) — the Drive simulator precedent; keeps
    `kmdb_icloud` free of a `kmdb_harness` dependency at production level.
    `safeOperationThreshold` derived from the CloudKit `QuotaProfile` quota
    knobs.
- [ ] Publish the CloudKit `CloudProfile` instance using the Phase 4a probe
      results. Set `ICloudAdapter.providesAtomicCas` from the Phase 4a finding.
      If zone-level CAS is not confirmed atomic, the adapter returns `false`
      so `ConsolidationCoordinator` gates consolidation off (loss-free).
- [ ] Run the H5 adapter conformance suite
      (`runSyncAdapterConformance({required factory, required expectAtomicCas})`
      from `package:kmdb/test_support.dart`) against the real adapter over
      `FakeICloudSyncChannel`.
- [ ] Unit tests for all six `SyncStorageAdapter` methods and zone-bootstrap
      behaviour, driven through `FakeICloudSyncChannel`.
- [ ] Wire real-adapter-over-`FakeICloudSyncChannel` into a `kmdb_harness`
      mixed-mode scenario (per-device adapters; two front-ends over one shared
      backend) and assert convergence.
- [ ] **Pre-release integration test** (skipped by default; enabled by env var
      `ICLOUD_TEST_CONTAINER`): full `SyncEngine` push/pull cycle and the
      contention test against a **real** CloudKit container — confirming the
      simulator's fidelity and the real atomicity behaviour. Not part of
      per-commit CI. The `packages/kmdb_icloud/example/` app (Phase 7) is the
      manual integration test vehicle for this, filling the role that `kmdb_ui`
      integration (Phase 5, deferred) would otherwise provide.
- [ ] Achieve ≥90% line coverage on the Dart parts of the package (via the
      `FakeICloudSyncChannel` path). Swift plugin code is excluded from the
      Dart coverage target.
- [ ] Conformance assertion: add a test that `FakeICloudSyncChannel` passes
      `runSyncAdapterConformance(expectAtomicCas:
      profile.atomicConditionalCreate)`, so the simulator and the adapter's
      `providesAtomicCas` cannot drift.

### Phase 5 — Flutter UI integration (`kmdb_ui`) (deferred)

> Deferred — `kmdb_ui` wiring is out of scope for this plan. The adapter and
> platform channel plugin (Phases 2–4) are self-contained and can be consumed
> directly by any iOS or macOS Flutter app. Key design notes for when the
> `kmdb_ui` settings integration is picked up:
>
> - No sign-in UI is needed; auth is implicit via the user's Apple ID on device.
> - `ICloudSyncChannel.isAvailable()` (checking `FileManager.ubiquityIdentityToken`)
>   should gate whether iCloud sync is offered in settings.
> - Account changes (sign out / different Apple ID) must invalidate the
>   adapter's cached zone state.
> - `ICloudRemoteConfig` (config-only sealed subtype in core `kmdb`,
>   `type == 'icloud'`, field `syncRoot`) can be added at that time following
>   the `GoogleDriveRemoteConfig` pattern.

### Phase 6 — Spec and docs

- [ ] Add `docs/spec/NN_icloud_adapter.md` (next available section number,
      assigned at creation time — see `plans/README.md`) covering: CloudKit
      zone model, ETag strategy, CAS semantics, platform limitations, and the
      Phase 4a probe findings.
- [ ] Record the Phase 4a probe results table in this plan.
- [ ] Register in `docs/spec/28_release_checklist.md`:
  - **RC-X (iCloud behaviour probe)** — empirical Phase 4a results must be
    re-verified after any major iOS/macOS version bump.
  - **RC-Y (iCloud real-service soak)** — full `SyncEngine` convergence
    against real CloudKit, two devices, contention test. Not automated.
  - Use next available RC IDs (currently RC-1 through RC-9 are taken).
- [ ] Update `docs/roadmap/0_03.md` to mark the Apple iCloud item done.
- [ ] Confirm `kmdb_icloud` (production package) takes **no** dependency on
      `kmdb_harness`.
- [ ] Build out `packages/kmdb_icloud/example/` as a minimal iOS/macOS Flutter
      app that constructs `ICloudAdapter` directly and runs a push/pull cycle.
      This is the primary manual integration test vehicle given that `kmdb_ui`
      integration is deferred — it lets a developer exercise the full stack
      (Dart → method channel → Swift → CloudKit) without a production app.
