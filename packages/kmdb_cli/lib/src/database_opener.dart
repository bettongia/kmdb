/// Opens a [KmdbDatabase] from a filesystem path.
///
/// [DatabaseOpener] is the CLI's entry point for database access. It performs
/// the two-phase device-ID initialisation and then opens a full [KmdbDatabase]
/// so that all write pipeline validation and augmentation (schema enforcement,
/// secondary index maintenance, FTS updates, vault ref counts) run for every
/// CLI write.
///
/// ## Vault wiring
///
/// A [VaultStore] is constructed unconditionally for every database this
/// opens — vault ref counting, GC, and content commands (`vault get`,
/// `insert --import`, `update --vault`, `export`, `backup`, ...) are
/// production-ready from the moment a database is opened, not opt-in. Lexical
/// vault content search is enabled by default via `vaultSearch:
/// VaultSearchConfig()`, with [HtmlTextExtractor], [MarkdownTextExtractor],
/// and [PdfTextExtractor] registered alongside the extractor `kmdb` always
/// auto-prepends (`PlainTextExtractor`) — so plain-text, HTML, Markdown, and
/// PDF vault blobs are all indexed out of the box. Semantic vault search
/// activates automatically once an [EmbeddingModel] is supplied via the
/// [embeddingModel] parameter — resolved from `config.embeddingModel` by
/// `cli_runner.dart`'s command-token-gated construction logic (WI-12 Phase B,
/// Q6) before this method is called, not inside this method itself.
///
/// ## Document-field semantic search (`vecIndexes`)
///
/// Unlike secondary indexes and FTS indexes (always derived from `config`
/// internally), [vecIndexes] is an explicit parameter the caller must build
/// from `config.vecIndexes` themselves, and must gate on [embeddingModel]
/// actually being non-null before doing so: passing a non-empty [vecIndexes]
/// while [embeddingModel] is `null` makes [KmdbDatabase.open] throw
/// [ArgumentError] (WI-12 Q9) — that would brick *every* CLI command against
/// a database with a registered-but-modelless vecIndex, not just search.
/// `cli_runner.dart` enforces this gate before calling [open].
///
/// ## Two-phase open
///
/// The device ID must be established before the full open so that SSTable
/// names use the correct stable identity:
///
/// 1. Open a minimal [KvStoreImpl] with the default device ID.
/// 2. Load (or generate) the stable device ID from `$meta`.
/// 3. If the device ID differs from the default, close the store without
///    flushing. The WAL will replay any writes from this phase on reopen.
/// 4. Open [KmdbDatabase] with the stable device ID and the index definitions
///    loaded from `local/config.json`.
abstract final class DatabaseOpener {

  /// Opens the database at [dbPath] and returns the database and a creation
  /// flag.
  ///
  /// The returned record is `(db, created)` where [created] is `true` when
  /// the database did not previously exist (i.e. no `CURRENT` file was present
  /// before this call) and `false` when an existing database was reopened.
  ///
  /// [config] supplies the index and FTS index definitions to register with
  /// [KmdbDatabase.open]. Pass [KmdbConfig.empty] when the config file is
  /// absent or cannot be parsed.
  ///
  /// [encryptionConfig] is the optional encryption credentials. Pass `null` for
  /// plaintext databases. When non-null the bootstrap reads `enc:blob` from
  /// `$meta` and derives the DEK; if the database is not encrypted an
  /// [EncryptionError] is thrown.
  ///
  /// [embeddingModel] is the real, already-constructed model to use for
  /// semantic vault search and document-field vector search — or `null` when
  /// no model is configured or the dispatched command doesn't need one (see
  /// `cli_runner.dart`'s command-token-gated construction logic, WI-12 Phase
  /// B Q6). This method does not construct a model itself.
  ///
  /// [vecIndexes] is the list of document-field vector index definitions to
  /// register, built by the caller from `config.vecIndexes` — but **only**
  /// when [embeddingModel] is non-null (see the class-level "Document-field
  /// semantic search" section for why this gate matters). Defaults to an
  /// empty list.
  ///
  /// Creates the directory if it does not exist.
  ///
  /// Throws [LockException] if another process has the database open.
  /// Throws [EncryptionError] if the encryption state mismatches the supplied
  /// config.
  /// Throws [ArgumentError] if [dbPath] is empty, or if [vecIndexes] is
  /// non-empty while [embeddingModel] is `null` (propagated from
  /// [KmdbDatabase.open] — see [vecIndexes]'s doc for why callers must avoid
  /// this combination).
