/// Interface for vault blob text extractors.
///
/// Implementations are responsible for decoding raw blob bytes to a plain-text
/// UTF-8 string for a specific set of media types. The extraction pipeline uses
/// the first extractor in [VaultSearchConfig.extractors] whose
/// [supportedMediaTypes] set contains the blob's [VaultManifest.mediaType].
///
/// ## Built-in implementations
///
/// - [PlainTextExtractor] — handles `text/plain` via charset detection (WI-2).
///
/// ## Optional extension packages (not core `kmdb` dependencies)
///
/// - `kmdb_extractor_pdf`'s `PdfTextExtractor` — `application/pdf` (WI-8),
///   wraps `betto_pdfium`.
/// - `kmdb_extractor_html`'s `HtmlTextExtractor` — `text/html` (WI-9), wraps
///   the `html` package with a custom node walk.
/// - `kmdb_extractor_markdown`'s `MarkdownTextExtractor` — `text/markdown`
///   (WI-9), wraps the `markdown` package with a custom AST walk.
///
/// These ship as separate optional packages (following the
/// `kmdb_extractor_<name>` convention) rather than as core `kmdb`
/// dependencies, and are registered by the library user via
/// [VaultSearchConfig.extractors]. DOCX remains a candidate for a future
/// extension package.
///
/// ## Contract
///
/// - Implementations MUST NOT throw; return `null` to indicate that extraction
///   failed or is not possible for this blob.
/// - Implementations MUST return valid UTF-8 text (or `null`).
/// - The input [bytes] are the **raw, decrypted** blob bytes. Encryption is
///   handled transparently by [VaultStore.getBytes] before calling the extractor.
/// - Implementations MUST honour an [ExtractorLimits] policy (accepted via
///   their constructor, defaulting to [ExtractorLimits.defaults]) and decline
///   extraction (return `null`) — never throw or hang — when a document
///   exceeds the configured input size, tree-walk recursion depth, or
///   wall-clock duration bounds. See [ExtractorLimits] for the rationale.
abstract interface class VaultTextExtractor {
  /// The set of MIME media types this extractor can handle.
  ///
  /// For example, `{'text/plain'}` or `{'application/pdf'}`. The search
  /// manager matches against [VaultManifest.mediaType].
  Set<String> get supportedMediaTypes;

  /// Extracts plain text from [bytes] according to [manifest].
  ///
  /// Returns the extracted UTF-8 text, or `null` if extraction fails or is
  /// not possible for this blob. The returned string may be empty.
  ///
  /// [manifest] provides metadata such as the original filename — some
  /// extractors may use it for format hints or logging.
  ///
  /// Implementations MUST NOT throw. Any internal error should be caught and
  /// logged, and `null` returned to indicate failure.
