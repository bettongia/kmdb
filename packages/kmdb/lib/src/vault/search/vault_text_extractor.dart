/// Interface for vault blob text extractors.
///
/// Implementations are responsible for decoding raw blob bytes to a plain-text
/// UTF-8 string for a specific set of media types. The extraction pipeline uses
/// the first extractor in [VaultSearchConfig.extractors] whose
/// [supportedMediaTypes] set contains the blob's [VaultManifest.mediaType].
///
/// ## Built-in implementations
///
/// - [PlainTextExtractor] — handles `text/plain` via charset detection (WI-2).
///
/// ## Extension points
///
/// Future WIs will add PDF and HTML extractors. They may be provided by
/// the library user via [VaultSearchConfig.extractors].
///
/// ## Contract
///
/// - Implementations MUST NOT throw; return `null` to indicate that extraction
///   failed or is not possible for this blob.
/// - Implementations MUST return valid UTF-8 text (or `null`).
/// - The input [bytes] are the **raw, decrypted** blob bytes. Encryption is
///   handled transparently by [VaultStore.getBytes] before calling the extractor.
abstract interface class VaultTextExtractor {
  /// The set of MIME media types this extractor can handle.
  ///
  /// For example, `{'text/plain'}` or `{'application/pdf'}`. The search
  /// manager matches against [VaultManifest.mediaType].
  Set<String> get supportedMediaTypes;

  /// Extracts plain text from [bytes] according to [manifest].
  ///
  /// Returns the extracted UTF-8 text, or `null` if extraction fails or is
  /// not possible for this blob. The returned string may be empty.
  ///
  /// [manifest] provides metadata such as the original filename — some
  /// extractors may use it for format hints or logging.
  ///
  /// Implementations MUST NOT throw. Any internal error should be caught and
  /// logged, and `null` returned to indicate failure.
